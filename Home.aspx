        Progressive rock (shortened as prog rock or simply progk) is a broad genre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom throughout the mid-to late 1960s, peaking in the early 1970s. 
        <br />the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk, or classical music. 
        <br />Lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of "art", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, 
        which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing.
        <br />
        <br />The golden age of prog took place all across the 70s, starting to decline in the mid-80s.
        <br />Bands like Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Camel, Mike Oldfield, Dire Straits, Genesis, Yes, Van der graaf Generator and many more
        were very popular in these years, some are still operating to this day!
