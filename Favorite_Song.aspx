        My Favorite Prog Rock song, (and probably in general) is "Telegraph Road" by the Dire Straits, from the album "Love Over Gold".
        <br />The song is a 14 minute epic, and is the first song on the album. It is about the beginning of the development along 
        <br />Telegraph Road and the changes over the ensuing decades. This was a metaphor for the development of America and the ruining of one man's dreams in the wake of its decline, 
        in particular focusing on unemployment.
        <br />The song features very emotional piano and guitar solos, and in my opinion the best instrumental section in it's last five minutes.
        <br />It really is a Banger!
